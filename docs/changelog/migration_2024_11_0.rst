.. admonition:: About this Document

    This document describes changes between buildstockbatch version 2023.11.0 and
    buildstockbatch version |version|

General
=======

This version should be backwards compatible with previous versions of
buildstockbatch except for being able to run in Eagle. Since Eagle is retired, BuildStockBatch no
longer supports buildstock_eagle command. If you are just comming upto speed with Kestrel, you can
use your existing yaml file by replacing 'eagle' with 'kestrel' and using buildstock_kestrel
command instead of buildstock_eagle command. See how to run in Kestrel :ref:`kestrel-run`.

See :doc:`changelog_2024_11_0` for details of this change.
